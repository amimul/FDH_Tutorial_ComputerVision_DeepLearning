# FDH_Tutorials_CV_DL
Computer Vision and Deep Learning tutorials for the course Foundation of Digital Humanities (Fall 2017)

## Clone the repository 
`git clone https://github.com/dhlab-epfl/FDH_Tutorials_CV_DL.git`

## Install the environment
* Install from yml file : `conda env create -f environment.yml`
* Activate the environment : `source activate FDH_tutorial_CV_DL`
* Once you're done with the exercice : `source deactivate`

## Run the notebooks
1. Image processing basics : get familiar with the principal concepts in image processing and computer vision (image handling, filters, denoising)
2. Deep learning : Tensorflow basics with MNIST example (single layer network and multilayer network)
3. Computer Vision Application : Face detection and features descriptors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

If you're already familiar with some concepts, feel free to go to the next notebook.
